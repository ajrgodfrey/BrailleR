# Improved Access for Blind Users

Blind users do not have access to the graphical output from R without
printing the content of graph windows to an embosser of some kind. This
is not as immediate as is required for efficient access to statistical
output. The functions here are created so that blind people can make
even better use of R. This includes the text descriptions of graphs,
convenience functions to replace the functionality offered in many GUI
front ends, and experimental functionality for optimising graphical
content to prepare it for embossing as tactile images.
