# Automatic fixing of typos

Fix up all those annoying typos that come up far too often.

## Usage

AutoSpellCheck(file)
```

## Arguments

- file:

  A vector of files to be checked

## Value

NULL. This function only affects external files.

## Details

The word list of typos and their corrections is called
