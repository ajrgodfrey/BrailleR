# Internal functions for the BrailleR package

Some functions that probably weren't really necessary, but proved useful
at some stage.

## Usage

``` r
FindCSSFile(file)



InQuotes(x)

nNonMissing(x)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  an object that is of the form needed by the internal function
  concerned.

- file:

  a filename to look for in the user's css folder or locally.

## Value

These should be fairly obvious from the name of the function
