GeomPoint,"
A geom_point layer created with the ggplot2 framework","
{{CommonScatterplotGen}}","
A geom_point by default will by closed black dots. This can be changed with the `shape` parameter, while the size and colour can be changed with the `size` and `colour` paramter. These can be set to categorical varaible to visually distinguish the groups"
GeomBar,"
A geom_bar layer created with the ggplot2 framework","
A geom_bar  will be vertical or horizontal rectangular bars. They can be of varying widths. Depending on the type of bar chart they may be touching or not and could even be stacked on top of each other. geom_histogram, geom_bar and geom_col all create the same ggplot object just with different settings to get different results. geom_histogram divides a single continuous variable into bins and counts the number of observatino in each bin then dispalys the counts with bar heights. geom_bar makes the height proportional to the number of observation in each group. geom_col make the height represent values in the data. A sighted user will be using either the height or area of the bar to determine the proportion/count of a certain group.","
Each of the three geoms are designed to create a bar plots for a partiuclar purpose make sure you are using the right one."
GeomBoxplot,"
A geom_boxplot layer created with the ggplot2 framework","
Boxplots are a rectangle that stretches from the lower quartile to the upper quartile. There is a line through the middle of this box which signifys the meadian. Coming out either end is a line that indicate variability outside of the upper and lower quartiles. Lastly any outliers are plotted as individual points past these lines.","
Your variable to plot can be added to either the x or y aes paramter and will determine the orientation of the boxplot. Adding a discrete varaible to the second axis will give you a boxplot of each group."
GeomSmooth,"
A geom_smooth layer created with the ggplot2 framework","
Provide a smoothed line fitting the data. It will normally span the whole x range and by default has 2.5% confidence interval shaded in on either side of the line.","
The shape of the line that is shown can vary significalty depending on what `method` is used. These can be set to "lm", "glm", "gam", "loess", but the default is loess"
GeomLine,"
A geom_line layer created with the ggplot2 framework","
A line layer will connect all the elements in the data with straight lines. It will do it in order of the variable in the x axis. By nature it will only span the range of the data. This leads the geom to be great for a time series plot","
It can be useful to multiple lines on the same plot so adding a discrete varaible to `colour` will give you multiple lines"
