This file documents the full object structure which is available to the whisker template.
Trailing asterisk indicates items introduced in the mustache preprocessing step.

Lists have a "sep" field to assist with natural language description of the list. 
Sep is blank for the final list item, "and" for the penultimate one, and "," otherwise.
