## Friedman Rank Sum Test

Description: Performs a Friedman rank sum test with unreplicated blocked data.
friedman.test can be used for analyzing unreplicated complete block designs (i.e., there is exactly one observation in y for each combination of levels of groups and blocks) where the normality assumption may be violated.

The null hypothesis is that apart from an effect of blocks, the location parameter of y is the same in each of the groups.
