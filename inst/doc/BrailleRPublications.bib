abstract={
R is one of the world's fastest developing open-source projects today. It is statistical software that is widely used in academic institutions, industry,
and research facilities. Because {R} is free, it has become an important resource for many statisticians in the developing world in particular. All the common
activities of the modern statistician are possible within R, such as data manipulation, calculation and graphical display.

R can be used successfully by screen reader users with a few modifications. In the presenter's opinion, this software is the best option available for
blind people needing to analyse numerical data.

Dealing with statistics is no longer the domain of mathematically competent people alone. Decisions in scientific research as well as in industry and government
are dependent on evidence. As a consequence, the ability to be literate with statistics, even at a basic level, is becoming even more important than it
was in the past. This will often be demonstrated by successful completion of a course in statistics as part of a degree at university.

Blind job seekers will improve their employment prospects if they are able to show their competence in dealing with statistics. {R} offers the blind person
access, especially if we link the ability to use the right software with our specialised hardware.

This tutorial will demonstrate how to import data and then create simple numeric and graphic summaries, such as those taught in the first few weeks of
most introductory statistics courses.

There are many tasks in statistics courses where sighted people use graphs. We will see that using {R} offers some alternatives to creating a graph.
