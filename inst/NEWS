# v0.27.1
- altered DESCRIPTION file to raise Paul and Debra to author from contributor in preparation for pull requests for VI.ggplot() work.
- changed R dependency sought by CRAN on 29/9/17 by email.
 

# v0.27.0
- added ProcessAllMd() for rendering plain markdown files.
- removed dependency on pander package by altering UniDesc(). Reason: Nice results, but possibly over the top for introductory students.
- added Language to the set of package options to be chosen by the user. This is necessary to then have the SpellCheckFiles() work properly.
- added GetExampleText() to help extract the example text from help pages.




# v0.26.0 for Annabelle
Pushed to CRAN on 6 July 2017

# v0.25.7
- ProcessAllRmd() function added: this processes all Rmd files in the specified folder using either rmarkdown::render() or knitr::knit2html()
- MakeBatch() changed to force Rmd file specific batch file to use rmarkdown::render() instead of knitr::knit2html()
- MakeBatch(file=NULL) now creates ProcessAllRmd.bat file in working directory so that users can process all Rmd files from Windows Explorer or the  DOS command prompt.
- VS offered BrowseSVG() and replacement cacc.js for improved interactive experience; JG fixed for CRAN checks.
- changes from VS merged via GitHub (not to be reported again)
- moved knitr package to imports. This means some of the Rmd files need more explicit mention of the package to get chunk options working properly.
- JG implemented the ViewSVG() so that anyone can use the interactive graph viewing system; required various internal functions to move and write necessary files 
- added FittedLinePlot() which adds a fitted line to the ScatterPlot() implmented through ScatterPlot(); these use a few internal functions, found in ScatterPlot.R
- added plot and print methods for various graph types. The print method refers to the plot function so acts just like the ggplot and lattice packages.
- restructured the storage of graph parameters and arguments for a variety of the masked functions. The intention is to make cleaning things up easier.
- adding examples to the graph making help pages to show that the BrailleR functions replicate base graphics functions
- added xlab(), ylab(), and main() for getting or setting these three parameters quickly. They only work for graphs that are created using BrailleR functions at this time.
- updated VI.gg() which add functions to create text elements so that accessible versions can be made; various internal functions added to get labels commonly found on ggplot() graphs.
- added Describe() so that a blind user can have the general appearance of a particular graph object explained to them. Text elements of the resulting description object can be pulled into the other accessibility tools under development.
- working on accessibility for scatter plots


# v0.25.6
- working on accessible Venn diagrams and time series plots
- fixed VI() method to handle additional arguments, although they are currently ignored.
- created function to choose long and short text for a boxplot; previously embedded in VI.boxplot()

# v0.25.5
- Added experimental work on making accessible graphs for mounting on the web
- added Volker Sorge and Donal Fitzpatrick to the package contributors list
- added MakeAccessibleSVG() and AddXML() as well as a bunch of internal functions to do the hard work.
- added Augment() method to take the functionality out of VI() that adds the content that feeds into the text descriptions because it will get used in other processes from here on.
- changes from VS merged via GitHub

# v0.25.4
- added JooYoung Seo and TK Lee to the package contributors list
- updated WriteR.pyw
- fixed small typos
- added MakeSlidy() which takes a folder of Rmd files and turns them into a slidy presentation

# v0.25.3
- WriteR() failed for JYS. Suggestion to use file.path() from HB added to WriteR(). Proved insufficient so hard wired quote marks for command line being issued have been included. JYS reported success.
- fixed URL for CRAN repository of package in CITATION file
- then fixed a bunch of other URLs from http to https in DESCRIPTION and vignette files.
- added folder of templates for (fairly) common analyses which are slightly beyond the OneFactor(), OnePredictor() etc 
type; it will also include the code chunks that are reused frequently in other functions.
- added UseTemplate() to make use of the template files faster. Not intended for wide use at this stage.
- Moved installr package from Imports to Suggests so that installation from GitHub works for OS!=Windows.
- removed use of require(<p kg>) and used requireNamespace("<pkg>") instead, and then used pkg::blah()
- added initial version of ThreeFactors()
- updated FindReplace() to avoid using pattern matching
- added Rnw2Rmd() to get a head start on the conversion from *.Rnw to *.Rmd 
- updated the BrailleR History vignette.


# v0.25.2
- fixed formatting of the R functions so it is easier to read. Request from Henrik Bengtsson resolved using the rfmt package seen at UseR!2016


# v0.25.1
- added SpellCheck() which is an interface to spell check a set of files, allowing ignore this time, always for all files, always for this file, replacement, and reading the word in context.
- added CleanCSV() for removing white space in (csv) files
- moved files from Inst to Inst/MyBrailleR for cleaner package installation. updated installation functions as needed.
- added AutoSpellCheck() for fixing all my irritating typos. 
- added AutoSpellList.csv for my list of typos to fix. Users can update this for themselves.
- added FindReplace() for replacing text strings in a specified file.
- added SpellCheckFiles() which is a wrapper for spell checking a file or files in a folder; this returns a list with the classed set to "wordlist" which has an associated print method. (based on similar functionality in the devtools package)
- added package hunspell to the growing list of dependencies
- fixed spelling in vignettes using SpellCheckFiles()
- added local and global options for lists of words to ignore during spell checking.

# v0.25.0
- did some overdue spell checking
- fixed wrong filename in PrepareWriteR() and its help page.
- added more Get*() commands to download and install several useful tools; based on functions from the installr package with the downloaded files going into the user's MyBrailleR folder. Python 2.7 and the associated wxPython version are hard wired at present until the dynamic links can be established.
- altered MakeBatch() to accept both upper and lower case R in file extensions.
- added ThankYou() to create an email message from a very short template.
- added LURN() to open the Let's Use R Now manual in a browser. It will open the version for blind users by default.
- added vignette on getting started with WriteR.
- updated vignettes
- updated WriteR.pyw and WriteROptions files. to v0.160530.0
- added GetWriteR() to download executable version for Windows users. This currently comes from GitHub by default, but was originally tested on http://R-Resources.massey.ac.nz; this can be used again if the user sets the argument UseGitHub=FALSE but the zip file downloaded must be moved to the right folder and manually unzipped. The function is currently unavailable due to problems with the executable file itself.
- added experimental VI.ggplot() thanks to starter from Tony Hirst
- added vignette for testing VI.ggplot() via ggplot2::qplot() calls. (This is far from complete.)
- added use of magrittr package to gain  the benefits of the pipe operator


# v0.24.2
- CRAN check uncovered need to have dependency of R >= 3.2.0. 

# v0.24.1
- fixed issue with inappropriate use of tempdir() in conjunction with paste0() instead of the more correct file.path(). Direct request from Brian Ripley on behalf of CRAN.
- removed use of tempdir() entirely for saving BrailleROptions and WriteROptions. Users must pull the defaults from the package until such time as they accept use of a folder on their own system, or a local copy of the settings.
- altered option setting commands to ensure no access to files if not running in an interactive session.
- altered help files accordingly

# v0.24.0
- Made ready for CRAN submission

# v0.23.10
- added MakeReadable() which cleans up vignette source files from installed packages, by converting tabs to spaces and Linux line breaks to Windows line breaks. This currently requires Python 2.7 to be installed.
-Added BrailleRHome() which takes the user to the BrailleR Project home page.
- Added JoinBlindRUG() which creates the email message needed for joining the Blind R User Group email list.


# v0.23.9
- added NewFunction() for creating a template R script file for a new function including Roxygen comment lines.
- fixed spacing problems in the output messages for MakeRmd()
- added constraint that some version of Python must be installed for WriteR() to work.
- added scope for WriteR() to call a file name for a file that does not yet exist. The file is created and then the application opens.
- added library(BrailleR) to first chunk created by UniDesc() and ifelse(VI, "library(BrailleR)", "library(knitr)") to the first chunk of the other convenience functions so the Rmd files can be converted without BrailleR being loaded. Discovered at University of Pretoria Boot Camp.
- Fixed MakeSlideshow() so that warnings for empty blank lines at the end of slides no longer appears.
- added MakeAllInOneSlide() function to be able to deliver slide show as a single file. Required for distributing talks given at DEIMS 2016


# v0.23.8
- Small changes to TwoFactors() so variable names get printed properly in tables.
- added author credentials to OneFactor(), OnePredictor(), TwoFactors(), and UniDesc().
- removed over-writing of files in example for TwoFactors(). Filenames will now indicate with or No interaction.
- dotplots in TwoFactors() have more meaningful filenames that reflect grouping variable used.
- fixed creation of ReadMe.txt in the MyBrailleR folder so that it gets the package version properly. Needed to include packageVersion() in the NAMESPACE file; also explicitly linked this command to the utils package in SetupBrailleR().
- added internal function .simpleCap() which is based on code in the example for toupper(); outcome is dependent on a new BrailleR option BrailleR.MakeUpper which is set to TRUE by default.
- added function SetMakeUpper() to control the presentation of variable names on graphs.
- made use of  .simpleCap() in UniDesc(), TwoFactors(), OneFactor(), and OnePredictor().
- fixed error in UniDesc where label for latex table was being garbled.

# v0.23.7

- added use of the css file chosen using BrailleR.Style to be used for UniDesc() etc.
- The MakeSlideShow() function is ready to go including addition of a contents slide.
- updated DESCRIPTION file to add GitHub links.

# v0.23.6
- reinstated use of a local file for local settings

- settings files will be copied to the user folder if needed.
- fixed case sensitive typo in BrailleROptions settings file for BrailleR.Embosser
- SaveMySettings() and RestoreMySettings() functions now redundant; removed as they were never released publicly.

- There is now  a set of defaults that can be restored in addition to the currently active set of preferences in the BrailleROptions file within the package.
- SaveMySettings() and RestoreMySettings() functions created for obvious outcomes. These are needed to protec from losing settings when the package is updated.
- A wrapper for WriteR is now included.
- MakeAllFormats() added to create pandoc settings files based on the foo.pandoc file in the inst folder.
