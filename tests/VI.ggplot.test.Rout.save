This chart has title 'Cars, cars, cars'.
The chart is comprised of 3 panels containing sub-charts, arranged horizontally.
The panels represent different values of am.
Each sub-chart has x-axis 'displacement' with labels 100, 200, 300 and 400.
Each sub-chart has y-axis 'Miles per gallon' with labels 10.
Each sub-chart has 2 layers.
Panel 1 represents data for am = auto.
Layer 1 of panel 1 is a set of 9 points.
The points are at:
(160,21), (160,21), (108,22.8), (120.3,26), (95.1,30.4), (351,15.8), (145,19.7), (301,15) and (121,21.4).
Layer 2 of panel 1 is a smoothed curve using method 'auto' with confidence intervals.
Panel 2 represents data for am = manual.
Layer 1 of panel 2 is a set of 17 points.
Layer 2 of panel 2 is a smoothed curve using method 'auto' with confidence intervals.
Panel 3 represents data for am = (all).
