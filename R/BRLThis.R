# @rdname BRLThis
# @title Convert a graph to a pdf ready for embossing
# @aliases BRLThis
# @description  The first argument to this function must be a call to create a graph, such as a histogram. Instead of opening a new graphics device, the graph will be created in a pdf file, with all text being presented using  a braille font. The function is somewhat experimental as the best braille font is not yet confirmed, and a number of examples need to be tested on a variety of embossers before full confidence in the function is given.
# @details The user's chosen braille font must be installed. This might include the default font shipped as part of the package.
# @return Nothing within the R session, but a pdf file will be created in the user's working directory.
# @author A. Jonathan R. Godfrey.

# @export BRLThis
# @param x the call to create a graph
# @param file A character string giving the filename where the image is to be saved.
