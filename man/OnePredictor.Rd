\title{Exploration of the relationship between a response and a single predictor}
\description{
A convenience function for generating exploratory graphs and numeric summaries, regression analysis output, and the residual analysis of the simple linear model.}
\usage{
OnePredictor(Response, Predictor, Data = NULL, 
    Filename = NULL, Folder = NULL, 
    VI = getOption("BrailleR.VI"), Latex = getOption("BrailleR.Latex"), 
   View = getOption("BrailleR.View"), Modern=TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{Response}{Name of the continuous response variable.}
  \item{Predictor}{Name of the continuous response variable.}
  \item{Data}{The data.frame that contains both the response and the factor.}
  \item{Filename}{Name of the Rmarkdown and HTML files to be created. A default will be created that uses the names of the variables if this is left set to NULL.}
  \item{Folder}{Name of the folder to store graph and LaTeX files. A default will be created based on the name of the data.frame being used.}
  \item{VI}{Logical: Should the VI method for blind users be employed?}
  \item{Latex}{Logical: Should the tabulated sections be saved in LaTeX format?}
  \item{View}{Logical: Should the HTML file be opened for inspection?}
  \item{Modern}{Logical: Should the graphics be created using ggplot?}
}
\details{This function writes an R markdown file that is knitted into HTML and purled into an R script. All graphs are saved in subdirectories in png, eps, pdf and svg formats. Tabulated results can be stored in files suitable for importing into LaTeX documents.}
\value{This function is used for creation of the files saved in the working directory and a few of its subdirectories.}
